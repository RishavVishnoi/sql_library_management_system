## Objectives

1. **Set up the Library Management System Database**: Create and populate the database with tables for branches, employees, members, books, issued status, and return status.
2. **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the data.
3. **CTAS (Create Table As Select)**: Utilize CTAS to create new tables based on query results.
4. **Advanced SQL Queries**: Develop complex queries to analyze and retrieve specific data.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup
![ERD](https://github.com/najirh/Library-System-Management---P2/blob/main/library_erd.png)

- **Database Creation**: Created a database named `library_management_system`.
- **Table Creation**: Created tables for branches, employees, members, books, issued status, and return status. Each table includes relevant columns and relationships.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE library_management_system;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS branch;
CREATE TABLE branch (
                    branch_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
					manager_id	VARCHAR(10),
					branch_address	VARCHAR(55),
					contact_no VARCHAR(20)
					);

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employees;
CREATE TABLE employees (
                    emp_id	VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
					emp_name VARCHAR(25),	
					position VARCHAR(25),
					salary	INT,
					branch_id VARCHAR(25) 
                    );

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS books;
CREATE TABLE books (
                    isbn VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
					book_title VARCHAR(75),
					category VARCHAR(20),	
					rental_price FLOAT,	
					status VARCHAR(15),	
					author VARCHAR(35),
					publisher VARCHAR(55)
                    );

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS members;
CREATE TABLE members (
                    member_id VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
					member_name	VARCHAR(35),
					member_address VARCHAR(75),	
					reg_date DATE
					);

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS issued_status;
CREATE TABLE issued_status (
                    issued_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
					issued_member_id VARCHAR(10), 
					issued_book_name VARCHAR(75),
					issued_date	DATE,
					issued_book_isbn VARCHAR(35),
					issued_emp_id VARCHAR(10)
                    );

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS return_status;
CREATE TABLE return_status (
                    return_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,	
					issued_id VARCHAR(10),	
					return_book_name VARCHAR(75),	
					return_date	DATE,
					return_book_isbn VARCHAR(20) 
                    );

--FOREIGN KEY
ALTER TABLE issued_status
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_members
FOREIGN KEY (issued_member_id)
REFERENCES members(member_id);

ALTER TABLE issued_status
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_books
FOREIGN KEY (issued_book_isbn)
REFERENCES books(isbn);

ALTER TABLE issued_status
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_employees
FOREIGN KEY (issued_emp_id)
REFERENCES employees(emp_id);

ALTER TABLE employees
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_branch
FOREIGN KEY (branch_id)
REFERENCES branch(branch_id);

ALTER TABLE return_status
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_issued_status
FOREIGN KEY (issued_id)
REFERENCES issued_status(issued_id);

```

### 2. CRUD Operations

- **Create**: Inserted sample records into the `books` table.
- **Read**: Retrieved and displayed data from various tables.
- **Update**: Updated records in the `employees` table.
- **Delete**: Removed records from the `members` table as needed.

**Task 1. Create a New Book Record**
-- "978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.')"

```sql
INSERT INTO books(isbn, book_title, category, rental_price, status, author, publisher)
VALUES ('978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.');
SELECT * FROM books;
```
**Task 2: Update an Existing Member's Address**

```sql
UPDATE members
SET member_address = '125 Main St'
WHERE member_id = 'C101';
SELECT * FROM members;
```

**Task 3: Delete a Record from the Issued Status Table**
-- Objective: Delete the record with issued_id = 'IS121' from the issued_status table.

```sql
DELETE FROM issued_status
WHERE issued_id = 'IS121';
```

**Task 4: Retrieve All Books Issued by a Specific Employee**
-- Objective: Select all books issued by the employee with emp_id = 'E101'.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM issued_status 
WHERE issued_emp_id = 'E101'
```


**Task 5: List Members Who Have Issued More Than One Book**
-- Objective: Use GROUP BY to find members who have issued more than one book.

```sql
SELECT m.member_name
FROM members m
INNER JOIN issued_status ist ON m.member_id = ist.issued_member_id
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### 3. CTAS (Create Table As Select)

- **Task 6: Create Summary Tables**: Used CTAS to generate new tables based on query results - each book and total book_issued_cnt**

```sql
CREATE TABLE book_cnts
AS 
SELECT b.book_title, COUNT(*) as issued_cnts 
FROM books b
INNER JOIN issued_status ist ON b.isbn = ist.issued_book_isbn
GROUP BY 1;			 

SELECT *
FROM book_cnts;
```


### 4. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were used to address specific questions:

**Task 7: Retrieve All Books in a Specific Category**:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM books
WHERE category = 'Classic';
```

8. **Task 8: Find Total Rental Income by Category**:

```sql
SELECT category, SUM(rental_price) as total_rental_income, COUNT(*) as no_of_times_issued
FROM books b
INNER JOIN issued_status ist ON b.isbn = ist.issued_book_isbn 
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

9. **List Members Who Registered in the Last 180 Days**:
```sql
INSERT INTO members
VALUES
('C131','Cersei','165 Road St','2025-06-05'),
('C132','Aemon','154 King St','2025-06-05');

SELECT *
FROM members
WHERE reg_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL'180 days';
```

**Task 10: List Employees with Their Branch Manager's Name and their branch details**:

```sql
SELECT e1.*, b.manager_id, e2.emp_name as manager
FROM employees as e1
JOIN branch as b ON b.branch_id = e1.branch_id
JOIN employees as e2 ON e2.emp_id = b.manager_id
```

**Task 11: Create a Table of Books with Rental Price Above a Certain Threshold 7 USD**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE books_price_greater_than_sevenusd
AS
SELECT *
FROM books
WHERE rental_price > 7

SELECT *
FROM books_price_greater_than_sevenusd;
```

**Task 12: Retrieve the List of Books Not Yet Returned**
```sql
SELECT issued_book_name
FROM issued_status ist
LEFT JOIN return_status rst ON ist.issued_id=rst.issued_id
WHERE return_id ISNULL;
```

## Advanced SQL Operations

**Task 13: Identify Members with Overdue Books**  
Write a query to identify members who have overdue books (assume a 30-day return period). Display the member's_id, member's name, book title, issue date, and days overdue.

```sql
SELECT ist.issued_member_id, m.member_name, b.book_title, ist.issued_date,
       CURRENT_DATE - ist.issued_date as days_overdue
FROM issued_status ist 
JOIN members m 
ON m.member_id = ist.issued_member_id
JOIN books b
ON b.isbn = ist.issued_book_isbn
LEFT JOIN return_status rst
ON rst.issued_id = ist.issued_id
WHERE return_date ISNULL
      AND (CURRENT_DATE - ist.issued_date) > 30
ORDER BY 1;
```



**Task 14: Branch Performance Report**  
Create a query that generates a performance report for each branch, showing the number of books issued, the number of books returned, and the total revenue generated from book rentals.

```sql
CREATE TABLE branch_reports
AS
SELECT br.branch_id, br.manager_id, 
       COUNT(ist.issued_id) as number_book_issued,
	   COUNT(rst.return_id) as number_of_book_return,
	   SUM(b.rental_price) as total_revenue
FROM issued_status ist
JOIN employees e
ON e.emp_id = ist.issued_emp_id
JOIN branch br
ON e.branch_id = br.branch_id
LEFT JOIN return_status rst
ON rst.issued_id = ist.issued_id
JOIN books b
ON ist.issued_book_isbn = b.isbn
GROUP BY 1,2;

SELECT *
FROM branch_reports;
```

**Task 15: CTAS: Create a Table of Active Members**  
Use the CREATE TABLE AS (CTAS) statement to create a new table active_members containing members who have issued at least one book in the last 2 months.

```sql

CREATE TABLE active_members
AS
SELECT * FROM members
WHERE member_id IN (SELECT DISTINCT issued_member_id
                    FROM issued_status
                    WHERE issued_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '2 month');

SELECT * 
FROM active_members;

```


**Task 16: Find Employees with the Most Book Issues Processed**  
Write a query to find the top 3 employees who have processed the most book issues. Display the employee name, number of books processed, and their branch.

```sql
SELECT e.emp_name,
       br.*,
       COUNT(ist.issued_id) as no_book_issued
FROM issued_status ist
JOIN employees e
ON e.emp_id = ist.issued_emp_id
JOIN branch br
ON e.branch_id = br.branch_id
GROUP BY 1,2;
```


## Reports
